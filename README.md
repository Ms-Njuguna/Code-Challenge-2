## Title
Week 2 JavaScript Code Challenge

## Description

This repository contains my solutions to the Week 2 JavaScript coding challenge. The challenge is organized into a folder with a dedicated `.js` file, '.html' file and '.css' file containing the solution code. The challenge tests working with forms, capturing user input, and updating the page dynamically using JavaScript — all without refreshing the browser. 


### Challenge:

#### **Event Guest List Manager **

This is a deliverable-driven challenge with the following deliverables: 
- A user should be able to type a guest's name into the input field.
- A user should be able to click a submit button to add the guest.
- A user should see the guest's name appear in a list on the page after they submit the form.
- A user should be able to remove a guest from the list using a delete button.
- Add a "Remove" button for each guest.
- Limit the guest list to 10 people — alert the user if they exceed the limit.
- Allow guests to be categorized as Friend, Family, or Colleague, with color tags.
- Display the time when each guest was added.
- Add an Edit button that allows updating a guest's name.
- My own custom feature: **Celebrate When Guest Limit is Reached**
